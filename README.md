# FRC-vision-processing
FRC vision processing source code for my FRC team
I was in charge of making the vision processing module for our school's FRC team's robot to detect hexagons with green reflective tape, as well as
guide the robot towards this hexagon using the coordinates of the detected hexagons on live camera feed.
